# Productivity App 
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg) 

## Description
As a team, we conceived and executed a design for a client-side single-page application. As we were working collaboratively, we continued to use agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests, using GitHub as a means to track the status of project tasks.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>

The design we selected for the project was a website designed to help you take control of your health and wellbeing productivity, by providing workout inspiration and tracking/scheduling of your progress. Our motivation for this was to aid users in time management. It also gave us a greater understanding of react and using different libraries in JS.
